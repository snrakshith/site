A dedicated React developer with 3 years and 5 months of experience, focused on delivering high-quality, user-friendly interfaces.

Currently, I am working as a **SDE** at **Ikure**, where I have been honing my skills for the past 2 years and 8 months. My work involves developing responsive and scalable front-end architectures, ensuring optimal performance and user engagement.

Before Ikure, I completed a 7-month internship at **Capdice LLP**, where I gained valuable experience in front-end development and contributed to several key projects.

Outside of work, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and have written technical articles on React and front-end development. I also actively contribute to open-source projects, continually refining my expertise and staying at the forefront of industry trends.
